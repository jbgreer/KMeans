K Means Cluster analysis

Just a sample implementation of K Means for 1D and 2D real-valued data.  Uses random initial centroid assignment,
bounded by the extrema of the data in the 2D sample.  The 1D creates its own fake data, but the 2D variant is
designed to read data from a CSV file, one pair per line.
